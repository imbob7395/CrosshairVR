I have a complete Unity project that builds a simple standalone app for Meta Quest. It displays a customizable floating crosshair in the center of your VR view—with adjustable color, size, style, and distance, all via a VR menu.

Unfortunately, I don’t have a PC or the ability to build the APK myself. I’m hoping someone kind would be willing to build this Unity project into an .apk so I can sideload it using SideQuest.

What’s Included: • Crosshair prefab fixed in center of view (good for FPS/aim training) • VR interface to adjust: • Crosshair color • Crosshair size • Crosshair distance • Crosshair style (dot, plus, ring) • Saves settings between sessions • Built with Unity 2022.3 LTS, XR Plugin Management, and OpenXR • A simple skybox scene • README with instructions inside the zip
